<p>Hi! I’m Dharun, one of your CS6120 Teaching Assistants this semester. I’m a grad student at Northeastern who’s spent some time juggling internships at Bevi and Clade, and I’ve also worked at Swiggy — basically the Indian version of Doordash, where I learned the art of getting things delivered on time (well atleast sometimes).

My interests bounce around from generative models to Consumer AI —  a fancy way of saying I like making machines understand language and everyday human needs without losing their minds. I’ve taken CS6120 before, so I know the thrill of wrestling with transformers and trying to get them not to hallucinate (especially when medical codes are involved).

I’m here to help make this journey a little easier (and maybe even fun). Feel free to reach out with questions, ideas, or to debate whether AI will ever truly “get” us humans. Looking forward to a great semester! 
</p>

### A Little More About Myself

Outside of academics, I’m a soccer enthusiast who’s been also known to turn any shower into a personal concert stage (yes, bathroom singing is a hobby). Master’s studies take up most of my time, but I always try to keep a balance between work and life(which is work mostly again).
