        - <b>Language</b> - the most efficient and compact way to transfer knowledge is through words, where the window to AGI is through NLP. This lecture is an introduction that takes us through history of how we got to LLMs. We'll also review some applications of NLP, current industry standards, and some of the most impactful approaches and where they are being implemented. Finally, we'll preview what we'll be learning, the logistics of how we'll be doing so, and the expectations for your participation in this class.

        - As NLP is a specific branch of machine learning, we will review some foundational knowledge that we'll utilize through the course of this class. We'll look at both machine learning and software engineering best practices that will help you build and scale NLP systems later in the course. Because most NLP algorithms today rely heavily on computing resources, we'll dive into distributed compution approaches and cloud-based operations.

        - This week, we will explore David Blei's contributions to the field, a set of concepts that indirectly attack the age-old question of <b>"what is <i>k</i> in the k-means clustering algorithm</b>. We will review the hierarchical nature of how to model natural language using Bayesian concepts, where our corpora is processed without preserving the order of words. This week also marks the first week of <a href="../readings/"><b>required keynote paper</b></a> reading, where we will begin the tour of seminal papers that have revolutionized not only language processing but also machine learning and artificial intelligence writ large. This reading is perhaps the most difficult one that you'll read in this class, since it involves a heavy component of probability and statistics.

        - Perhaps the most influential paper to have come out of the natural language community is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546"><i>word2vec</i> paper</a> that most general machine learning practioners recognize. You'll find elements of its practice in communities from the information retrieval sciences to modern cyber applications to general ML problems. As it pertains to language models, modeling words is often the first stage in any system pipeline that you may design. This week's lecture reviews word models (including word2vec as well as continuous bags of words) and the embeddings / representations that they create.

        - The next three weeks are devoted to the state of the art in industry, and LLMs in practice, which may have changed in the time that you have started this course! This week, we introduce large language models using the fundamentals that you have learned, from perplexity in system design to transformer neural network layers for pre-training. We'll focus on techniques that large companies (or well-funded ones, at least) use to create <i>foundation</i> LLM models, taking training methods from OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon, and Google.

        - You've learned about the inner workings of the LLM, the mechanisms that power it, how and when to tune it, the data collection processes that govern it, how it can be used practically, and the agents that can run on it. In this lecture, we explore the practical aspects of GenAI engineers when product managers ask them to design a system for them. More than the theory, we'll learn about the system itself, devoting time for *when* to focus on certain components of your LLM, and the life cycle of your system design.
