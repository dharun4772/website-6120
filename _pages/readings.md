## Keynote Reading Schedule

Keynote papers are required reading that underly the fundamentals of modern natural language processing theory and practice. Each week, students should sign up for a paper. [Please do so here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVrHl8MgkrXhJnYbW5QJP4wEPROlPaSz8xGR1JDtIfY). Updates (it might take a few minutes) on the current schedule can be viewed here:

### Reading Group Schedule

For each of the papers, during the *following week*, there will be two sets of student partners creating a five minute pitch, writing a summary, and making a video about the paper. Specifically, these two teams will be divided as follows:

---

**Team One**: Summarize the seminal work in short and concise ways. Make sure you review the pros and cons of the algorithm. What problems do you see the proposed approach solves? Where do you think there could be room for improvement? What are some challenges associated with the paper?

* **Video Presentation**: Describe the paper, its nuances, and crucial perspectives. (5min)
* **Summarizing 1 Pager**: Provide a brief overall summary of the paper (1pg)

---

**Team Two**: Make a pitch to the class on why technology is game changing. You can think about this presentation as something you would give to a VC or a Ph.D. defense committee. Be prepared to face adversarial questions and defend the work from fellow students and teaching assistants. 

* **Elevator Pitch** Pitch the paper to the class as if it were novel 
* **Scribe**: Notes taking on interesting topics to share out to other students
