### Reading Group Schedule

For each of the papers, during the following week, there will be a reading group _discussion_, which the lead will facilitate. Even though there are leads and co-leads, everyone is expected to contribute in the conversation. Additionally, as there are no lecture notes for the discussion, a scribe will record salient points from the discussion; where these can be posted weekly.


* **Lead**: Facilitator and discussion generator
* **Discussion**: Everyone should have read the paper for an interesting discussion
* **Paper Summary** An summary of the paper (one-pager), providing an overview of the work
* **Scribe**: Notes taking on interesting topics to share out to other students
